## ⚙️ Build and Compile the Source

> [!TIP]  
> Please confirm that your development environment meets the requirements before compiling.

### 1. 🖥️ Visual Studio 2026

Ensure that your installation includes the appropriate workloads:

- On the **Workloads** tab of the Visual Studio installer, check:
  - **.NET Desktop Development**
  - **Desktop development with C++** (Required for Native AOT and Win32 interop)
  - **WinUI Application Development**

### 2. 🛠️ SDKs

Ensure you have the following installed:
- .Net **10.x**
- Windows 11 SDK (10.0.26100.0)

### 3. Installed the **XAML Styler** extension (Optional for Building, Required for Contribute):
[XAML Styler for Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamXavalon.XAMLStyler2022)

### 4. 🔗 Debugging & Admin Privileges

AutoOS requires Administrator privileges for many of its operations. If the debugger is not attaching to the process, you are required to set `EnableLua` to `0` and restart your PC. This is a known WinUI 3 limitation:

```bat
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```

Make sure your environment matches these requirements to avoid issues during compilation.

## 🖌 Code Style & Formatting

- **All XAML files** must be formatted using [XAML Styler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamXavalon.XAMLStyler2022).
- The settings are defined in `Settings.XamlStyler` located in the root directory.
- Run **XAML Styler** on any new or updated XAML files before committing.

## 🧼 Code Guidelines

### ✂️ Partial Classes
All helper and component classes must be marked as `partial` to support **Native AOT** compilation and source generation.

```csharp
public partial class MyHelper
{
    // ...
}
```

or

```csharp
public static partial class MyHelper
{
    // ...
}
```

### 🚫 Avoid Reflection
Avoid using reflection-based logic, or any indirect type access. These break Native AOT compatibility..<br/>
Don't use `DllImport` or `LibraryImport`. Use `NativeMethods.txt` instead.
