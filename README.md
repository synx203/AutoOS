AutoOS is a WinUI3 application focused on automation to improve performance while ensuring privacy and compatibility.

## ✨ Features
- Automatically set every monitor to their highest supported refresh rate
- Automatically optimize GPU, XHCI Controller and NIC affinities
- Easily update GPU driver with one click
- Toggle XHCI Interrupt Moderation without having to restart
- Toggle between service states with configured functionality
- Apply all hidden BIOS Settings (600+) in one click
- Automatically import Epic Games and Steam titles from old install
- Custom Game Launcher supporting (Epic Games, Steam, Riot Games, Eden, Citron, Ryujinx)
- Stop processes when running your game to stop all unnecessary services and executables

## ⚠️ Current Issues
- **Blank screen after installing the Graphics Driver:** You may experience a blank screen in the App after installing the Graphics Driver. To fix this, resize the window from the left side until it rerenders the UI.

## 🚀 Getting Started

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to change the display language of Windows, do so **after** AutoOS is fully set up.

**Step 1:** Before installing, please join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bZU4dMMWpg) to receive installation support and stay informed about future updates or changes.

**Step 2:** Download the latest Windows 23H2 ISO file from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZxTVzvKROzOQ_o4bzUvv0PY86HL0JiuY?usp=sharing) (You have to use a Chromium based browser like Edge, Chrome, Brave, etc.). Other ISOs are currently not supported. 

**Step 3:** Go to the Drivers / Support page or your Mainboard / PC and download your LAN, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth driver (No Audio, Chipset, or anything else). On prebuilts and laptops you may also need the disk driver (Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver) otherwise you may get a bluescreen. 

Extract all `.zip` files (for `.exe` files, there may be an extract option in the setup, otherwise use 7-Zip, NanaZip, or WinRAR to extract them) and move all extracted folders into one folder.

**Step 4:** Open PowerShell **as Administrator**.

**Step 5:** Paste this into the PowerShell window to download and run the deployment script.

```ps1
$PSDefaultParameterValues['Invoke-WebRequest:UseBasicParsing'] = $true
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force 
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinodin/AutoOS/master/deploy.ps1 | iex
```

If you get any errors during the script, its most likely because your current operating system has disabled services that are required. Make sure to you use a default installation of windows to run the script.

**Step 6:** Once the script finished, restart your computer and boot into the default option. Make sure to `keep your ethernet cable connected` or `connect to your WiFi in the setup`. Then wait for Windows to finish installing.

**Step 7:** Once finished, wait for AutoOS to open up (On slower systems this may take a minute).

**Step 8:** Select your settings and click "Install AutoOS". This process will take around 30 minutes.

If you want to delete your old Windows partition and merge the unallocated space with the AutoOS partition, use [Minitool Partition Wizard Free](https://cdn2.minitool.com/?p=pw&e=pw-free) (decline each offer in the installer). Then use the `Delete` function on the old Windows partition and the `Extend` function on the AutoOS partition and max out the slider. Click appy and restart. Make sure to delete `Minitool Partition Wizard Free` again after you are done.

## ⚙️ Build instructions

### 1. 🖥️ Visual Studio 2026 Insiders

Ensure that your installation includes the appropriate workloads:

- On the **Workloads** tab of the Visual Studio installer, check:
  - **.NET Desktop Development**
  - **WinUI Application Development**


### 2. 🔗 Clone the repository

Clone the repository and run this in the terminal inside of Visual Studio.  
```
dotnet nuget add source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dotnet/CommunityToolkit/_packaging/CommunityToolkit-Labs/nuget/v3/index.json -n CommunityToolkit-Labs
```

If the debugger is not attaching to the process you sadly are required to set EnableLua to 0. This has been a problem for 5 years and Microsoft hasn't provided a fix:
```bat
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```
