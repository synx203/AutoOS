AutoOS is a Native AOT WinUI 3 application that automates Windows setup and optimization with a focus on gaming performance, privacy, system compatibility and quality of life improvements.

## ✨ Introduction
There are plenty of "Windows Debloat" scripts and apps out there, but most of them rely on basic CMD / PowerShell scripts / commands, apply non-researched tweaks, and end up breaking core Windows functionality or security.

There is also a lot of Discord Servers selling services to apply custom ISOs / playbooks or install poorly coded AI utilities that rely on poor research and public knowledge.

With AutoOS I have completely reimagined the way Windows is installed and used. AutoOS is written in **C#** and **WinUI3** while being fully **NativeAOT** compatible and utilizing **Win32 APIs**. It is tailored towards **competitive gamers** and **power users** while being **fully open source** and receiving **regular updates** that don't require you to reinstall Windows every time.

### The Installation Process
For the installation, users are provided with the latest `25H2 Professional ISO` which is built and updated by GitHub Actions using the `uupdump API`. Check out my [uup-dump-get-windows-iso](https://github.com/tinodin/uup-dump-get-windows-iso) repository.

The installation bypasses the need for unreliable and slow USB drives and instead relies on a PowerShell Script to create a new partition, apply the `install.wim`, add the custom `unattend.xml` file and create the boot entry.

The **unattend.xml** file does the following:
- Removes and disables 8.3 file names before installing Windows
- Creates a local user account
- Cleans up visual clutter
- Disables automatic driver/app installation via Windows Update
- Removes web results from Windows start menu
- Precompiles .NET assemblies to improve PowerShell loading times
- Pauses Windows Updates for 100 years
- Adds Recycle Bin to Quick Access
- Sets the correct Timezone, Regional format, Keyboard Layout and secondary language for your country
- Downloads and installs the latest version of AutoOS

After Windows is installed you are greeted with the **AutoOS Installer**.

### AutoOS Installer
In **AutoOS Installer** you can:
- Personalize your Windows Theme settings which are integrated using my [Auto Theme Switcher Windhawk Mod](https://windhawk.net/mods/auto-theme-switcher).

On startup **AutoOS Startup** does the following:

### AutoOS Startup
- Syncs the time
- Applies the MSI Afterburner profile
- Applies sound buffer sizes for selected input and output devices
- Disables XHCI Interrupt Moderation (IMOD) for selected XHCI Controllers
- Launches OBS Studio if selected
- Cleans up temporary files

Up until this point all the work has been done by me and me alone. I have spent countless hours every day. There is still some work to do and I am looking for contributors or suggestions to make this a big community project.

## ⚠️ Current Issues
- **Blank screen after installing the Graphics Driver:** You may experience a blank screen in the App after installing the Graphics Driver. To fix this, resize the window, click the navigation pane button a few times or just wait until it rerenders the UI.

## 🚀 Installation Guide

**Step 1:** Before installing, please join my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bZU4dMMWpg) to receive installation support and stay informed about future updates or changes.

**Step 2:** Download the latest Windows 25H2 ISO file from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BlAYofjlW1bU-WPG3jXygO1ezoJ4gPs7?usp=sharing) (Log into your Google Account if you get an error). Other ISOs are not supported to guarantee consistency and the latest features. 

**Step 3:** Download your Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth driver (No Audio, Chipset, etc). 

**INTEL:** [Ethernet](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/727998/intel-network-adapter-driver-for-microsoft-windows-11.html) · [Wi-Fi](https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/9qjxlr4x59dv9ncusmu3h/INTEL-WiFi.zip?rlkey=v1mzzc37onjmcpundt48u8i83&st=pnj3c3ax&dl=0) · [Bluetooth](https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/qoylgflunti1fhzpcjnip/INTEL-Bluetooth.zip?rlkey=j23dopqk2ek1r5ju00zemwsf2&st=wopu40cj&dl=0)

**Realtek:** [Ethernet (Win10/Win11 Auto Installation Program (NDIS) - Not Support Power Saving)](https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/gr47u24zve7ll7lmel9ke/Install_Win11_Win10_10079_20_DMAROFF_01262026.zip?rlkey=pp7modxp8ht1zxcwlu5foam8l&st=vsxyeok0&dl=0)

If your Ethernet / Wi-Fi / Bluetooth adapter is not listed above, go to the Drivers / Support page or your Mainboard / PC and download them from there.

Extract all `.zip` files (for `.exe` files, there may be an `extract option` in the setup, otherwise use `7-Zip, NanaZip, or WinRAR` to extract them) and move all extracted folders `into one folder`. The folder should contain each driver and their `.inf` files.

On Prebuilts and Laptops you may need to disable `VMD Controller` in your BIOS, otherwise you may get `Inaccessible boot device` BSOD. It might be called differently in your BIOS. For Alienware go to `Storage -> SATA/NVMe Operation` and change it from `Disabled` to `AHCI/NVMe`. 

Alternatively download the [Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver](https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/itfp030swc9a6am4gug2y/SetupRST.zip?rlkey=a5fz4afsfog5pkndbnovgl84s&st=lp8664cf&dl=0).

**Step 4:** Open PowerShell **as Administrator**.

**Step 5:** Paste this into the PowerShell window to download and run the deployment script. Then select the **ISO** and your **drivers folder** or skip the driver installation if you are sure that you don't need them.

```ps1
$PSDefaultParameterValues['Invoke-WebRequest:UseBasicParsing'] = $true
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force 
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinodin/AutoOS/master/deploy.ps1 | iex
```

If you get any errors during the script, it’s most likely because your current operating system has disabled services that are required. Make sure to use a default installation of Windows to run the script. If you can't figure it out leave a message in my discord server.

**Step 6:** Once the script finished, `restart` and boot into the `default option`. Make sure to `keep your ethernet cable connected` or `connect to your WiFi in the setup`. **DO NOT BYPASS THE NETWORK REQUIREMENT!** Then wait for Windows to finish installing.

**Step 7:** Once finished, wait for AutoOS to open up.

**Step 8:** Carefully look through every tab and select your preferences and apps. Then click "Install AutoOS". This process will take around 15-30 minutes.

### What to do after the installation is finished?
- `Disable` the toggle in `Services & Drivers` tab and restart whenever you are `Gaming`.
- `Enable` it again and restart if you need functionality back for `Work` etc.
- For `Riot Games` titles to show up in the `Games` tab, install them through the `Epic Games Launcher` as well.
- Go to the `Games` tab while `Services & Drivers` are disabled and press the `Play` button.
- Once you are in the `Game`, press the `Stop Processes` button. 
- Press the `Restart Processes` button to restore the taskbar etc.
- Check the `BIOS Settings` tab for recommendations.
- If your output device supports a lower buffer size than 10ms in the `Sound` tab, lower it in exchange for higher CPU usage.
- Leave a `review`, share `suggestions`, or report `issues` on the `Discord Server`.
- [Donate](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=GVEVUSHUWXEAG) if you appreciate the immense time and effort I have put into creating and providing this project for free.
- If you have experience with `C# and WinUI3` and want to become a part of the project, let me know.

### What **NOT** to do after the installation is finished?
- Run other `tweaks` or `optimizers` like `CTT` etc.
- Apply `timer resolution` because it does more harm than good.
- Set `visual effects` to `Best Performance`, `disable animations / transparency / paging file`. 
- `Uninstall` `MSI Afterburner, OBS, Everything, Windhawk, StartAllBack` or any of the `runtimes`.
- `Install` `7-Zip`, because `NanaZip` is already installed.
- `Uninstall` more AppX Packages like `Xbox Game Bar` or `Microsoft Edge` because it **breaks functionality**.

If you want to delete your old Windows partition and merge the unallocated space with the AutoOS partition, use [Minitool Partition Wizard Free](https://cdn2.minitool.com/?p=pw&e=pw-free) (decline each offer in the installer). Then use the `Delete` function on the old Windows partition and the `Extend` function on the AutoOS partition and max out the slider. Click apply and restart. Make sure to delete `Minitool Partition Wizard Free` again after you are done.

## ⚙️ Build instructions

### 1. 🖥️ Visual Studio 2026 Insiders

Ensure that your installation includes the appropriate workloads:

- On the **Workloads** tab of the Visual Studio installer, check:
  - **.NET Desktop Development**
  - **.Desktop development with C++**
  - **WinUI Application Development**

### 2. 🔗 Clone the repository

Clone the repository and run this in the terminal inside of Visual Studio.  
```
dotnet nuget add source https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dotnet/CommunityToolkit/_packaging/CommunityToolkit-Labs/nuget/v3/index.json -n CommunityToolkit-Labs
```

If the debugger is not attaching to the process, you are required to set EnableLua to 0 and restart your PC. This has been a problem for 5 years and Microsoft hasn't provided a fix:
```bat
reg add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System" /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
```
